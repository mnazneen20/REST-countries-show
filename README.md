# REST countries show

This is a frontend challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

In this challenge I have built an UI where users can :

-> See all countries from the API on the homepage

-> Search for a country using an input field

-> Filter countries by region

-> Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page

-> Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

For building this site I used the `REST API` from [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).
`React`, `CSS`, `MUI` are used to develop the site.
